# BlueRaptor
# Purpose

This repository is my personal bootc image based off of [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/). It was mostly created because I wanted to switch away from rpm-ostree, but I was layering a single package [ckb-next](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next). I wanted this baked into the image so here we are!

It is just ublue-os/bluefin-dx:latest with some additional packages installed.
